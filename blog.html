        <h3>Top skills a full stack developer should have</h3>
        <h5>Author by Raghu Mohan</h5>
        <p>I’m going to use the most popular example to define a full-stack developer. If there’s one person who wore many
        hats in his lifetime, it’sLeonardo Da Vinci. He was a painter, scientist, mathematician, cartographer, geologist, 
        astronomer, historian, musician, and sculptor. People believe that diverse experiences fed into his creative genius, 
        making him a nonpareil innovator. If this extraordinary Renaissance man was a programmer today, he would be what we 
        call a “full-stack” developer. Murky picture becoming a little clearer, I hope. Until about a few years ago, a well-planned 
        and perfectly functional website required just two kinds of people to be up and running: a web designer and a web developer. 
        Cut to the present day. Developers now identify with over 24 such specific job titles, including front-end web developer, 
        back-end web developer, mobile developer, and desktop developer. Understandably, nomenclature is becoming increasingly complex
        to work with. It is often restrictive (and unfair) to have one job title to describe your distinct skill sets. For instance, 
        consider the findings of a 2015 survey by Stack Overflow: for the third year in a row, a majority of respondents (30%) identified 
        themselves as “full stack developers” when asked to categorize their occupation. Sowho are full stack developers? No, they aren’t 
        mythical creatures who are magically endowed with expertise across the software development terrain.
        Full stack developers are ordinary mortals like the rest of us. Michael Wales of Udacity describes a full stack developer as one 
        who can work cross-functionally on the full “stack” of technology, i.e. both thefront end and back end. In layman’s terms, 
        they are jacks of all trades and masters of one (or many, as opposed to none).</p><br>
        <p>Gone are the days when developers got by knowing only one programming language. Today, designers and developers share a greater 
        area of the product development Venn diagram. They are more equipped to work withmyriad technologies starting with the back end to
        the front end. It takes them years of rich practical experience to earn theirstripes as good full stack developers, which is why many 
        consider thema rare breed of talent and commitment. Despite the concept having its fair share of naysayers, these wizards are still 
        sought after by smaller companies and startups in the fledgling phase where their diversity and versatility are highly appreciated.
        Looks like your cup of tea? If not, here’s an interesting videowhere Microsoft’s Scott Hanselman could well change your mind.</p>
